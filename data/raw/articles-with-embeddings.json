    "abstract": "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n",

    "abstract": "  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation\nrelations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has\ngained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck\nscale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n",

    "abstract": "  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for\napplications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations.

We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n",

    "abstract": "  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions.

Computational times\nincrease steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a\ncluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program\nis the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of\ncomputers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large\nparticles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current\nlimitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.\n",

The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n",

The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found.

Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n",

The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days, with\nan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. We demonstrate\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant.

    "abstract": "  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for\nnanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,\nphotodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\ncorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature\na stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical\nanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.\n",

    "abstract": "  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way\ndepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover\nmass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\nglobular cluster system.\n",

    "journal": "JHEP 0706:061,2007",
    "abstract": "  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\n",

    "abstract": "  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a\nnearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\n",

The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is\ninvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the\ntransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore\nthe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation\nfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for\nthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,\nthe experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization\nfor the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with\nour TMRG results.\n",

The difference\nbetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of\ndata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the\ntrue properties of the phenomenon.

    "abstract": "  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium\nselfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\\omega$ meson we\ndemonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of\nthe mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;\nmore consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any\nmass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral\nfunctions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay\nbranching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a\nquantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be\npart of any reliable theory.\n",

By\nanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\nproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\nQSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\n$\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$\narcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.\n",

    "abstract": "  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather\nunexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots\nare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein\nfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein\nData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered\nones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most\ncomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that\nits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the\nproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and\nsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only\nappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of\nsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the\nenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a\nshort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a\nknotted structure in this protein.\n",

We derive the rate equations describing\ndynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.\nSolving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,\nas well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found\nthat in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are\ndirectly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,\ndepending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation\nholds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating\nenvironment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no\nlonger holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either\nin the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In\naddition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the\nstrong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star\ncluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that\nthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its\nsmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While\nit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of\ndynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings\nsupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller\nsub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the\nsupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should\nnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.\n",

Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n",

The wavelength interval\nexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time\nrender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.\nOn the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states\nof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in\nthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the\nH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the\nV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary\nto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of\nNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability\nepisode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare\nwith t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.\n",

Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the\ndereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H\nfor all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor\nstar, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In\naddition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with\nrespect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting\nthe spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison\nof the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO\nabsorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf\nstars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the\nspectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is\nobtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star\ncontribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%.

    "abstract": "  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength\nmonitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with\nflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very\nhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet\nmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our\nmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce\nthe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value\nfor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due\nto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the\nhigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence\nof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role\nin the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to\nthe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and\ngamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton\nemission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral\nvariability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis\npatterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day\ntime scales.\n",

    "abstract": "  Graphene multilayers are grown epitaxially on single crystal silicon carbide.\nThis system is composed of several graphene layers of which the first layer is\nelectron doped due to the built-in electric field and the other layers are\nessentially undoped. Unlike graphite the charge carriers show Dirac particle\nproperties (i.e. an anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization and square\nroot field dependence of the Landau level energies). Epitaxial graphene shows\nquasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which may\npersists above cryogenic temperatures. Paradoxically, in contrast to exfoliated\ngraphene, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in high mobility epitaxial\ngraphene. It appears that the effect is suppressed due to absence of localized\nstates in the bulk of the material.Epitaxial graphene can be patterned using\nstandard lithography methods and characterized using a wide array of\ntechniques. These favorable features indicate that interconnected room\ntemperature ballistic devices may be feasible for low dissipation high-speed\nnanoelectronics.\n",

Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and\ninclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and\nthe tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a\ncluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\ntimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\nstars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius\nup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the\nexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or\nless).

    "journal": "JHEP 0705:086,2007",
    "abstract": "  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event\nparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\nmulti-jet observables.\n",

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n",

    "abstract": "  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks\nhas uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.\nTherefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these\nnetworked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more\ndetailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of\nnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose\nan evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network\nstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\nstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of\nthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the\nintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial\ndisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of\nnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting\nintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network\nso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,\nit is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world\neffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering\ncoefficient in a network.\n",

    "abstract": "  Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteen\nGHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources are\nselected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are\nfrom our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS\nsources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the\nabsorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.\n  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for\nthe first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicating\nthat they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us.\nThis result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources\n(or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232,\nJ2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showing\ndouble-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Three\nsources J1057+0012, J1600-0037 and J1753+2750 are considered as core-jet\nsources according to their morphologies and flux variability.\n",

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct\nmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for\nboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it\nstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type\ngalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function\nwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope\n(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy\nsample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and\nintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local\nmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,\nearly-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type\ngalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The\nuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include\nuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the\ngalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive\nblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.\nThat is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)\nh^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in\nsupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.\n",

One of the\ninteresting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for\nthe different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon\ndynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS)\n$\\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via\nsuitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect\nof the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the\nchiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is\nincluded by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective\nfield theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the\nprevious calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM).

    "abstract": "  We show that the conditions which originate the spin and pseudospin\nsymmetries in the Dirac equation are the same that produce equivalent energy\nspectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles in the presence of vector\nand scalar potentials. The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapes\nof the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. When\nboth scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for\nisospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper\ncomponent or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making it\nequivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,\nbesides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular\nmomentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper or\nlower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle. We point out a few\npossible applications of this result.\n",

    "abstract": "  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a\nhigh degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode\ndeformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to\ngravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications\nfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core\ncollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,\nperformed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low\nT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the\nnonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which\nshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the\ncorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode\ndeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are\nconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an\nimportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,\nwhich has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable\namplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.\n",

    "abstract": "  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general\nnetworks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have\na fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n",

    "abstract": "  The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a\npure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne,\nrespectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane\nand 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure\nmethane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to\na ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have\nbeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,\nwith a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration\nprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling\nwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and\ndioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,\nallene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,\n1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a\nPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from\n700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,\nsome improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our\nlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main\nreaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6\naromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.\n",

We point out that the\nchannel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter\nspace at the CNGS beam is $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$. The reason for that is\ntwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\nis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\nwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\nextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n\\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile\nneutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is\nsignificantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.\nData from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the\nfour-neutrino model parameter space.

    "abstract": "  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits\naround a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in\nQ, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.\nThis system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation\nreaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the\nCarter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\nto linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\nshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\nsystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional\nassumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric\nspacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.\n",

    "abstract": "  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain\nwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into many\nproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to\ntheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\nconnectivity.\n",

    "abstract": "  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of\ndomains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability\nbecause of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic\nnetworks.

This provides sufficient conditions for a process that\nsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in\nthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial\ningredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for\nsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to\nshow weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance\nprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some\nsufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in\nconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the\npolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries\nand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.\n",

Our simulation results have demonstrated that both central\ncollisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also\nform a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and\nlong duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward\nflow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body\nones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body\ncentral collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$\nin contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the\nnovel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide\na good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.\nThe Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built at\nLanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expected\nto make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state\n(EoS).\n",

This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional\nconditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The\nconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing\nhorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,\nhowever, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit\nnon-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in\nany n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D\nWeyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \\Phi_{ij}. In the case with\n``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''\ncase \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \\Phi_{ij} coincide with those\nof the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike\ndirections of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing\nthe twistfree condition and assuming instead that \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The\nn=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are\nbriefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.\n",

In this paper, we\npresent a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We\nfind that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface\ndensity. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is\nsimply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be\nobtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous\ntorque in the disc.

    "abstract": "  We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with the High Energy\nTransmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\\em Chandra X-ray\nObservatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.\nThe lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,\nsome of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,\nhowever, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of\nthe present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \\AA\\\nwas about $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of\nthe observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of\n$0.06 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This\nimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale\nof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the\nobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are\ngenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the\nbinary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical\ncondition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.\n",

These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk\naround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes\nthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\nreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\ndetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the\ndust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures\naccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a\nmodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures\naccording to distance.

We base our\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can\nbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color\ncorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra\nwith other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is\ndominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by\nstate-of-the-art disk models.

We present the mass function\nfor the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.\nThis result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the\nAntennae galaxies.\n",

It is also found that\nthese phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\nrigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the\nfluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.\n",

It is shown that such isovector collective state is\nexcited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric\nsystems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the\nfused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and\nvibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR\nenergy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental\ndata, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also\nquantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the\npre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be\nsuitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive\nbeams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.\n",

Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are\nknown, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved\nspectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the\nIP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains\na white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min).

Understanding the mechanisms which\nlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete\npicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster\nformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial\nvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &\nMatteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the\ndistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric\nradius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular\nclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the\nobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can\nbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar\npopulations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population\nof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very\ngood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity\ndistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of\nmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity\ntransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model\n(abridged)\n",

    "abstract": "  We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and\n[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate\nthe density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board\nSpitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed\n[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density\nlimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and\nignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have\nlower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line\nflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that\ndifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in\nthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit\nand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the\ntorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of\nextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line\nratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities\nassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We\nalso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended\nand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from\nlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from\nsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby\ngalaxies.\n",

To\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu\n}\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu})=\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n",

In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude\nthat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear\nequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its\nisovector sector.\n",

We compute the Z -> gamma gamma partial\nwidthin the framework of the recently proposed renormalizable gauge sector of\nthe noncommutative standard model. The one-loop renormalizability is obtained\nfor the model containing the usual six representations of matter fields of the\nfirst generation. Even more, the noncommutative part is finite or free of\ndivergences, showing that perhaps new interaction symmetry exists in the\nnoncommutative gauge sector of the model. Discovery of such symmetry would be\nof tremendous importance in further search for the violation of the Lorentz\ninvariance at very high energies. Experimental possibilities of Z -> gamma\ngamma decay are analyzed and a firm bound to the scale of the noncommutativity\nparameter is set around 1 TeV.\n",

Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\n",

A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could\nconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned\nto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution\nof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.\n2006.

It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas\n(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending\non the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is\nconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local\nand global resources.

Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result\nof [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling\nleads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The\nrunning coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape\nof the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a\nconsiderable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the\nevolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is\ndue to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the\nsubtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.\nThese subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate\nnumerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that\nwhen the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in\nthe two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then\nuse the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find\nthe numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with\nthe running coupling corrections.

    "abstract": "  The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. We\nanalyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs\nbosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by\ncombining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on\nfull simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM\nHiggs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We\nstudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta\nplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects\narise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via\nhigher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into\nsupersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should\nbe achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM\nparameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM\nHiggs bosons at the LHC.\n",

    "abstract": "  Using local morphological measures on the sphere defined through a steerable\nwavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for\ncorrelation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable\nwavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to\ndefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,\norientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between\nthe WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The\nmost significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the\nsigned-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting\nsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the\ncorrelation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and\ninstrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all\nsignificant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the\nISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced\nbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the\nUniverse. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our\ndetection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for\ndark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to\nhelp us to better understand the nature of dark energy.\n",

At present all\nknown string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level\nof detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may\npresent a challenge to string cosmology.\n  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation\nthat in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the\nHubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For\nthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an\nextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r\n> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are\nsuperheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV.

    "abstract": "  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths\nof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming\ngalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)\nabsorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\n",

The catalog covers SDSS\nStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz\nsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we\ncompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and\nstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter\nthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g\nand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)\nquasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted\nflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\nGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for\nquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the\nvariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main\nstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of\nlightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar\nlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like\nbehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo\nsubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc.

The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies\nsuggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the\ncollapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star\nmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive\nhelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during\ncore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few\nmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent\nevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence\ncompanions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars\nin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the\nstrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain\nsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.\n",

    "abstract": "  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch\nelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These\ndistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic\neffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport\nalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the\nelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we\nbegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic\nstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations\nencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are\ncomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states\nof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,\nusing previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic\nstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can\ndescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the\npresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the\nsubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which\nleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several\norders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched\nstructure.\n",

Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the\nsuppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a\nbulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and\nthe ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an\nindicator of a deconfined partonic medium.

We further generalize this formalism to take into\naccount the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized\nstraightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.\n",

    "journal": "Phys. Rev. E 75, 061105 (2007)",
    "abstract": "  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal\ntransmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical\nthreshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\nin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between\nShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for\noptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is\nachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the\nnoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal\ndistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical\nverification and justification for previous work in both computational\nneuroscience and electronics.\n",

A particle motion in\nthis system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface\ndensity of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,\nwe sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle\nmotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a\nfinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these\ndifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we\ninvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that\nsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy\nspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different\nfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This\nsuggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of\nthe orbit via the gravitational waves.\n",

    "abstract": "  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have\nsuggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope\nnear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black\nhole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does\nhave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN\nand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well\nfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.\nAlthough a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by\nadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.\n",

    "abstract": "  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in\ncomplex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,\nfamilies, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent\nchanges in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the\nassociated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.\nOur knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is\nlimited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and\nself-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental\ndifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.\n",

    "abstract": "  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled\nstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well\ndefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.\n",

Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model.

A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in\nthe range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent\nclassifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to\nlocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface\nmass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local\ngalaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density\nrelation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local\nprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the\nnearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more\nimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of\nthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the\ngalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red\ngalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from\nCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive\ngalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription\nof Wolf et al.

    "abstract": "  With the anticipated launch of GLAST, the existing X-ray telescopes, and the\nenhanced capabilities of the new generation of TeV telescopes, developing tools\nfor modeling the variability of high energy sources such as blazars is becoming\na high priority. We point out the serious, innate problems one zone\nsynchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. We\nthen present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, time\ndelayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account.\nBy introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, our\ncode can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situation\ntypical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproduce\nvariability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeV\nflares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.\n",

Numerical solutions computed using\ndifferent boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution\nobtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each\nboundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and\nextracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,\nthereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These\ntests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein\nequations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are\nreviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is\npresented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the\nincoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the\nconstraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather\ndifferent approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial\ncompactification, are also tested.

We explore the distribution of our\nhomogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso.

    "abstract": "  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that\nrecovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density\nmatrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability\ndistribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure\nstate density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple\ngenerating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit\ntrace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent\nrelations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under\ncontraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.\nAs examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we\nconsider a quantum system evolving by It\\^o stochastic and by jump process\nSchr\\\"odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace\nformalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian\nmotion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov\nmaster equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies\ngeneralizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett\nmaster equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast\nstochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state\nvector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment\nbehaves like the latter.\n",

We solve numerically\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\nranges of these parameters.

The catalog contains 77,429 objects; this is an increase of over\n30,000 entries since the previous edition. The catalog consists of the objects\nin the SDSS Fifth Data Release that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0\n(in a cosmology with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7)\nhave at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s, or have\ninteresting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i=15.0, and have\nhighly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the catalog is 5740 sq. deg. The\nquasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; the\ncatalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are at\nredshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i <\n19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positions\naccurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz)\nCCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the\nmorphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio,\nnear-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available,\nfrom other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the\nwavelength region 3800--9200A at a spectral resolution of ~2000. The spectra\ncan be retrieved from the public database using the information provided in the\ncatalog. The average SDSS colors of quasars as a function of redshift, derived\nfrom the catalog entries, are presented in tabular form. Approximately 96% of\nthe objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS.\n",

The equivalent width of the D lines\nis computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)\nof the stars.

The absorption\ncoefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with\nthe distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated\nposition-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different\nvalues of the exponent q.

The most intense maser emission\nat a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or\nouter edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line\nof sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).\nParticularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar\nto the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy\nNGC 4258.

    "abstract": "  We present wide-field BVI photometry for about 11,500 stars in the\nlow-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bump\nfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected\nrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss\ntheoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the\ninclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb\ninteractions may be partly responsible.\n  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent\nand the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\nlarge distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that\nthe stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density\nstructure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually\nlow central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of\nthis, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the\nfrequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.\n",

The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays\nproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical\ndepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks\nat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in\nthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb\npinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings\nB/B_\\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent\nexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally\noccur at B/B_\\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced\nmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\\phi=n. At the\nnoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the\ninterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer\nstates that have an overall orientational order.

    "abstract": "  The Hamiltonian of a N-boson system confined on a ring with zero spin and\nrepulsive interaction is diagonalized. The excitation of a pair of\np-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuation\nof many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states\ncan be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is\nstudied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating\nfrom the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the\nappearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided into\nbeing collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relation\nbetween the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysis\nand evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storage\nsystem. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of\noverlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels\nhave been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and\nerror detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors\noc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the\nhierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The\nmodels have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for\nsystem-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject\nfaults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and\nrecovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault\nmodels are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk\nfailures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the\ndisks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given\nsubmodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the\nlower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and\nanalyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate\n(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms\nimplemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the\naccumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.\n",

For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor\nagreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and\nstrengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for\nresonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance\nstrengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than\nour estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%\n(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between\nthe calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly\nto the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in\nthe experiment.

One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose\nassemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails\nand clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.\nAntennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to\nlocal antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally.

The large\nsample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear\nrelations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the\nisophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations\nbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the\noptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group\nhierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be\naccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy\nluminosity or mass.

    "abstract": "  In Volborthite, spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\\'e lattice, of corner\nsharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$\non the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that\ndespite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.\nAlthough sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very\nlarge, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy\nlifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the\ndegeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality\nHamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition\non increasing $J'/J$, from $\\sqrt 3\\times \\sqrt 3$ type order to a new\nferrimagnetic {\\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is\nconfirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While\nthe saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections\nselect the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum\nlimit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system\ndiagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate\ntemperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen\nin NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical\nground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.\n",

We report on a search for short-duration\ngravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the 64-1600 Hz frequency\nrange appearing in all three LIGO interferometers. Signal consistency tests,\ndata quality cuts, and auxiliary-channel vetoes are applied to reduce the rate\nof spurious triggers. No gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 days\nof live observation time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 0.15 per day (at\n90% confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to be\ndetected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized using\nMonte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previous\nsearches. We also provide rough estimates of the distances at which\nrepresentative supernova and binary black hole merger signals could be detected\nwith 50% efficiency by this analysis.\n",

To image\nthe putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to\nbetter understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular\ngas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region\nof M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,\nyielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show\nno clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the\nradio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate\nfeatures located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western\nfeature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity\ncorrespondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting\nthat this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated\nnearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the\nsame direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This\nvelocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the\nputative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular\ngas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the\njet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-\nor Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.\n",

We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and\nfind strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best\nfitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed\nfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The\nrate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent\nwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal\nmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the\ngeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different\nenvironments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03\nalso shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but\nthe trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A\nnonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and\nthe overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is\nunlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the\nsurrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;\ninstead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star\nformation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.\n",

    "abstract": "  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and\nNovember 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the\nXRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one\nof the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared\ntelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In\nJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical\nand X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60\nbrighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005\nobservation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In\nNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent\nstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the\nJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall\nwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or\nhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,\nbut the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on\nmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term\nvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a\nunique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are\ninterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a\njet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends\non the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).\n",

    "abstract": "  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for\nplanetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the\nprobability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the\nlensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which\nperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost\noccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\\lesssim 20$, implying that probability\ncan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability\nincreases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of\nevents associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even\nat magnifications as low as $A\\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target\nof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events\nwith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted\nevents. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the\nbrightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain\nmagnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\\lesssim\n10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars\nwith magnifications $A\\gtrsim 70$.\n",

    "abstract": "  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of\nprotoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular\nmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of\noutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications\nfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,\nx-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150\ng/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have\naggregated to 1 micron in size.\n",

Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra\nX-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms\npulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution\nshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of\n$\\dot P = 7.5112(6) \\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise\nand/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\\pm5%$\nmodulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\\sim 70%$\nduty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed\nemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\\Gamma =\n1.2\\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The\ntotal 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.\n",

    "journal": "Astropart.Phys.31:201-211,2009",
    "abstract": "  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n",

The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the\niodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles\nfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric\norbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb\noriginates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg\ninto near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the\nSun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories\ntraverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases\nthe probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.\nCorroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields\n~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.\n",

The results are good agreement with the extensive numerical\nsimulations.

The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the\nCasimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real\ndielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric\npermittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the\nLifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be\nconsistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric\nplates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,\nis not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature\nasymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also\nin the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are\nshown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a\nfinite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric\nplate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat\ntheorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to\nthe Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge\ncarrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of\nspatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,\nthe conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency\ndispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all\npresent experiments.\n",

    "abstract": "  Charmless 3-body decays of B mesons are studied in the framework of the\nfactorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result.\n",

    "abstract": "  We show that the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be investigated\nwith the tail emission of the prompt GRB. The tail emission which we consider\nis identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed\nby the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive,\nfor the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail\nemission for various jet models. The new definitions of the zero of time and\nthe time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for\nfitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which\nis useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB\njet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay\nindex of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be\nseen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay\nindex distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially,\nif we observe events whose decay index is less than about 2, both the uniform\nand the Gaussian jet models will be disfavored according to our simulation\nstudy.\n",

We obtain, for all anisotropies, the\nantiferromagnetic spin-liquid spin-wave velocity and the Isinglike\nferromagnetic excitation spectrum gap, exhibiting the spin-wave to spinon\ncrossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The\nin-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic\ncorrelation in the out-of-plane s_i^z component, at higher temperatures in the\nantiferromagnetic XXZ chain, dominantly at low temperatures in the\nferromagnetic XXZ chain, and, in-between, at all temperatures in the XY chain.\nWe find that the converse effect also occurs in the antiferromagnetic XXZ\nchain: an antiferromagnetic s_i^z s_j^z interaction induces a correlation in\nthe s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the\nantiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to\nanisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the\nisotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY)\nanisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and\ntemperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.\n",

We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the\ndegeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the\nright-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into\nseparate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is\nused. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or\ninf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze\nhow they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We\nsuggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case.

The\ngeneralized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness\nof the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other\nassumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the\npositiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several\nequivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation\nfor research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric\nproblems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of\nthe jumps.

In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric\nMSSM-like Type II Gepner orientifold constructions admitting boundary states\nassociated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L-\nand/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane\ninstantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only\ninstantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to\ncontribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of\nfluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold\ncompactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries\nto generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with\nMSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the\nrequired zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other\nhand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner\nmodel $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged\nnon-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A\nfew more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints\non the zero modes.

From this perspective the\nrenormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the\ncouplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the\nspace of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large\nvariety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points\nincludes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field\ntheories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed\npoints. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are\nconformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions\nare infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary\nconditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes\nwe analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the\nrenormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy\nevolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does\nnot affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in\none-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.\n",

    "abstract": "  Current expectations on the signal to noise ratios and masses of supermassive\nblack holes which the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can observe are\nbased on using in matched filtering only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral\nwaveform at twice the orbital frequency. Other harmonics will affect the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of systems currently believed to be observable by LISA.\nMore significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would\nmean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\\it not}\nvisible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show\nthat we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and\nobserve the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\\sim\n10^8M_\\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA\nwill be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total\nmass $\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot (10^9M_\\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency\ncut-off of $10^{-4}{\\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\\sim 60$\n$(\\sim 30)$ at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the astrophysical\nviewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this\nmass range is quite strong and binaries containing such supermassive black\nholes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the\ndominant harmonic.\n",

    "abstract": "  The contribution of a spin-rich $qqq$ force (in conjunction with pairwise\n$qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked\nout in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be\nignored, so that the dominant effect is $Coulombic$. A distinctive feature of\nthis study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a\ngenuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on\nas many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.\nThe dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)\nformulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality\nPrinciple (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D\nBethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these\ningredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\\phi$ receives\nwell-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a\n$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \\sigma_1.\\sigma_2\\times \\sigma_3$\nwhich is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic\nsingularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a\nspin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature.

    "abstract": "  Data from {\\it Chandra} observations of thirty nearby galaxies were analyzed\nand 365 X-ray point sources were chosen whose spectra were not contaminated by\nexcessive diffuse emission and not affected by photon pile up. The spectra of\nthese sources were fitted using two spectral models (an absorbed power-law and\na disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the\nspectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function\ndepends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>\n10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\\sim\n80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray\nsources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk\ntemperature $\\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\\Gamma \\sim 2$) with those of the\nlower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known\nbackground AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed\n$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The\nspectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black\nbody model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct\nspectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and\nhence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures\n$\\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk\ntemperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they\nharbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\\sim 0.5$ times\ntheir Eddington Luminosity. The radiative mechanism for hard ELX, seems to be\nInverse Comptonization, which in contrast to standard black holes systems, is\nprobably saturated.\n",

    "abstract": "  Using an integration formula recently derived by Conrey, Farmer and\nZirnbauer, we calculate the expectation value of the phase factor of the\nfermion determinant for the staggered lattice QCD action in one dimension. We\nshow that the chemical potential can be absorbed into the quark masses; the\ntheory is in the same chiral symmetry class as QCD in three dimensions at zero\nchemical potential. In the limit of a large number of colors and fixed number\nof lattice points, chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously, and our results are\nin agreement with expressions based on a chiral Lagrangian. In this limit, the\neigenvalues of the Dirac operator are correlated according to random matrix\ntheory for QCD in three dimensions. The discontinuity of the chiral condensate\nis due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula recently discovered for\nQCD in four dimensions at nonzero chemical potential. The effect of temperature\non the average phase factor is discussed in a schematic random matrix model.\n",

Stellar parameters are determined using an automated\nfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the\ngenetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 and\nLH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation\nscenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample\ncontains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be\n~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs\nand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating\nevolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient\nrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to\nan increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings\nfor SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such\nmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly\n(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be\nintermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and\ncomparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good\nagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) <\n6.1.\n",

    "abstract": "  The two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when exposed to an oscillating\napplied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,\nsecond-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the\nperiod-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in\nthe same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first\ntime the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,\nperiod-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a\nsquare-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,\n\\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for\nthe critical isotherm, \\delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies\nthat H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size\nscaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period\nprovides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,\nfor a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature\nT_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and\nfield amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use\nof the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,\n\\partial<Q> / \\partial H_b, in the critical region.\n",

    "abstract": "  The effect of the electron density stratification on the intensity profiles\nof the H I Ly-$\\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar\ncoronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large\nscale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona\nat the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to\ndetermine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar\ncorona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The\nmain assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the\ncoronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun\nfrom the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are\nsensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.\nHowever, Ly-$\\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The\ncalculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a\nlesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed\nones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed\nprofiles of Ly-$\\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered\nelectron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few\nstratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data\nresult in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close\nto the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions\nare employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered\nobservables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the\nvelocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as\nprevious investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...\n",

The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933,\nHS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of\n3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS\n0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)\nh. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS\n0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital\nperiod of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed\nphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic\nbehaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new\nadditions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent\nof the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the\nrequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the\nmodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,\nthe predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming\nmore pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period\ninterval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by\nour results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the\nHamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital\nperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close\nto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the\nstandard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the\nhighest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of\ncommon properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.\n",

It is discussed how such models\ncan be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.\nTwo detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong\nconstraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental\nHamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice.

    "abstract": "  This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical\nguarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional\nmodels? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage\nregression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the\nsecond stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use\nhypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two\nstages as \"screening\" and the last stage as \"cleaning.\" We consider three\nscreening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise\nregression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain\nconditions.\n",

    "title": "Depletion effects in smectic phases of hard rod--hard sphere mixtures",
    "journal": "Eur. Phys. J. E 21, 175 (2006)",
    "abstract": "  It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods\nthe stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this\neffect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper\nwe first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this\nparticular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting\nthe usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations\nfrozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres\nof different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results\nindicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease\nsignificantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when\ncompared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation\napproximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter,\nwhich has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We\npresent closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected\nwith the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry\nby comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes\n(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results\nbased on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure\ndensity--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of\ndifferent sizes. In this case, we show that the $\\tau$ parameter exhibits a\nlinear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod\naspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of\nlarge values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast\nto Onsager approximation, which predicts $\\tau\\sim d^3$.\n",

The\nB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of\nthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on\nthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe\nfor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the\nnon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary\nthese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the\nHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of\nnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available\nATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search\nchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter\nspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider\nsensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it\nmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small\nor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.\n",

    "abstract": "  We argue that the weak coupling regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs\nphase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are\nmeta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.\nThey decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all\nincident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the\nplasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose\nmultiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of\nE. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by\nthe plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross\nproperties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of\nfundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the\nplasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black\n(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which\nimplies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT\nduality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we\nconjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.\n",

    "abstract": "  When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time,\nthe leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of\nthe pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the\nself-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for\nGW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the\nevolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the\nsource. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration\nof the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be\nrelevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a\nradius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge\nbetween binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated\nGW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave\ndistortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in\nnumerical simulations.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs),\nreaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs with good photometric accuracy for\ntwelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between\n~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different\nparts of the SMC such as the \"Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In\nthis paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields\nthrough comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We\nfind that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of\nboth intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show\nstrong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in\nthe Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the\neastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star\nformation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the\nwestern side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF\nanalysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these\nparts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in\nthe southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern\nfields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the\nCMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred\nfrom the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are\ndominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack\nof a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate\nthat a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed\nfields.\n",

We show that the transition\nfrom the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse\nautomatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling\nsolution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor.

This task is\nfacilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a\nvariance reduced by the self-correlation time (\\tau), and whose effect on the\nNIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when\nthe stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\\emph{Gaussian} which, being a\n\\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \\emph{compact-support} one for\n(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from\nGaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other\nphenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field\napproximation and with an emphasis on the \\emph{order parameter} and the\n``\\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'\nstatistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\\tau), it is shown that\nwhereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of\nself-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it.

    "abstract": "  The present paper introduces a linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model\ndescribing a self-synchronizing phase transition in a system of globally\ncoupled oscillators that in general have different characteristic frequencies.\nThe reformulated model provides an alternative coherent framework through which\none can analytically tackle synchronization problems that are not amenable to\nthe original Kuramoto analysis. It allows one to solve explicitly for the\nsynchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full\nphase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators\n(unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the\nmean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it\npossible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.\nWhile discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling,\nthe new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to\nsolving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.\n",

From a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340\nglobular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotation\naxis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for the\nhalo of NGC 5128. The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radial\ndependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular cluster\nsample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0)\nglobular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and\nmetal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the\nplanetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions\nof the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass\nestimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal\nrandom motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine\nthe mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)\nMsun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and\n(1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius\nof 50 kpc.

The flexible\ndispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the\nlinear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to\nanalyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results\nexhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the\nlimits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms.\nCombining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or\nat least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.\n",

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We\nassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is\ntransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a\nstochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent\nshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts\nseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric\nluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN\nlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies\nand their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central\nblack hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the\nstrength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback.

    "abstract": "  High-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region is\nreported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR\n4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and\nseveral H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the\nnear-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission\nthrough the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.\nThe 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the\nspectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be\ncircumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the\noxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the\npreviously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line\nprofiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer\nnear the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and\nthe spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar\nand M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity\nof $\\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar\nabundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance\nwinnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the\nsubsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the\nHR 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical AGB values:\n12C/13C=6^{+9}_{-4} and 16O/17O>200.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present single pointing observations of SiO, HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$\nfrom the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope towards 23 massive star forming regions\npreviously known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact HII regions. We\ndetected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the\nother nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without\nongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards\n17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all\nsources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. For seven infall\ncandidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\\times10^{-2}$ and\n2$\\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show both SiO detections\n(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance\nof H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources\nfor which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect\nto current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey,\nwe suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion\nmay be important in describing the evolution of a massive protostar (or\nprotostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.\n",

These approximants are rational functions which encompass any\nsaturation with a finite number of resonances as a particular example,\nexplaining several results which have appeared in the literature. We review the\nmain properties of Pade Approximants with the help of a toy model for the\n<VV-AA> two-point correlator, paying particular attention to the relationship\namong the Chiral Expansion, the Operator Product Expansion and the resonance\nspectrum. In passing, we also comment on an old proposal made by Migdal in 1977\nwhich has recently attracted much attention in the context of AdS/QCD models.\nFinally, we apply the simplest Pade Approximant to the <VV-AA> correlator in\nthe real case of QCD. The general conclusion is that a rational approximant may\nreliably describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, but the same is not true\nin the Minkowski regime due to the appearance of unphysical poles and/or\nresidues.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)\ndumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate\nReynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a\nset of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The\ndynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.\nMomentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an\nadditional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both\ncomponents of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way\ncoupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of\nmotion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow\nfor different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by\nWeissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in\nour study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic\nproperties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy\nbudget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to\n20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the\ndumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,\nincreasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry\nof the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the\nstreamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched\nreferentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate\nthe local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.\n",

    "abstract": "  The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in\nnature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy\ncutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating\noperators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard\nModel introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,\nquantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating\nthat the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum\ngravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation\nfor the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge\nsymmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,\nsuch a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed\nneutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the\nelectroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These\nrequirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a\nU(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of\nleft-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.\nThe existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future\nexperiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton\ndecay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension\nfour baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number\nviolating operators and R-parity violation.\n",

Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical\nstudy of the space of proper colorings (solutions).\n  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree\n(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase\ntransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.\nFirst, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the\nphase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond\nthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the\ncritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine\ntheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.\n  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue\nthat the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering\ntransition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the\nrelevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL\nalgorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.\n",

    "abstract": "  We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for\nchemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass\n1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of\nthe self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure\nfor a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to\nnonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities\nand effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased\npolar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on\nthe degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation\nrate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation\ngenerally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead\nto the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a\nfeature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of\ndifferentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be\nshifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in\nluminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between\nM and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,\nincluding (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the\nproperties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a\nreduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the\nnuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers\nbeneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like\noscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some\n1.5-2 M_sun stars.\n",

    "journal": "Astrophys.J.663:1252-1268,2007",
    "abstract": "  During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is\ntransported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially\nrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The\npredominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The\nradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and\n~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of\ninterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted\nangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little\nviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be\nrequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models\nillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the\nbuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes\nis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or\nmay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes\nof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst\nproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.\nThe carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important\nfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

However, the 2-local model\nHamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types\nof interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the present\npaper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to\nexperimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic\nquantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known\nQMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local\ntransverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is\nperhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for\nadiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered\nuniversal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.\nWe also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only\n1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.\n",

The IR through mm\nspectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25\nand 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous\nsubmm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which\nis associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.\nIn our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with\ntotal flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA\ncm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in\nthe MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature\nof 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and\ninterferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores\nin this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While\nthe overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks\ndo not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by\n2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two\nstars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O\nstars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no\nobvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our\nobservations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud\nhas taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O\nstars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears\nto be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type\n(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.\n",

This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very\noutermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale\nstructures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of\nsubstructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile\nbetween 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is\nparticularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting\nresults reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a\nfaint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least\n150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a\nHernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger\nthan theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/-\n0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is\nsimilar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying\nhalo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected\nfrom modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended\nmetal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of\nscale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a\nchallenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged]\n",

Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string\ntheory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,\nwe study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be\ncentral to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge\nsymmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these\ntwo kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string\nvacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the\ndegree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities\nof realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string\nscale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that\nnearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet\ntachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level\nheterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.\n",

    "abstract": "  If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew\nadiabatically, then a dense \"spike\" of dark matter is expected to have formed\naround it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH\ncan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to\nannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even\nexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus\npredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinity\nof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners\nare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate\ncores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the\nexistence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its\ndensity profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP\nburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core\nmasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the\nobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be\nconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We\nalso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of\ngamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark\nmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the\nEGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision\nmeasurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter\nspike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent\nlimits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.\n",

The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared\nwithin different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high\nenergy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock\nenergy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).\nFor very small values of $\\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be\ncomparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.\nHowever, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required\nto account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs\nare therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk\nLorentz factor (e.g. $\\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\\sim 10$ GeV are\nattenuated by two-photon pair production processes.

Thus, to precisely determine the properties\nof the Higgs boson at hadron colliders, the soft-gluon resummation effects have\nto be taken into account.\n",

A real circle can be defined as the image of\nthe real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,\nand roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (\"the\n${\\mathbb{K}}$-axis\") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension\n$\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)\\thickapprox\\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation\n$\\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)\\to\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)$.\n  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of\nthe specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,\nvia $\\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a\nsuitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at\ninfinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of\ncircles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the\ndimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many\n${\\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.\nMoreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation\nof hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of\ncurves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the\nsimplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.\n",

    "journal": "Astrophys.J.663:1040-1048,2007",
    "abstract": "  By combining high-resolution (HST-WFPC2) and wide-field ground based (2.2m\nESO-WFI) and space (GALEX) observations, we have collected a multi-wavelength\nphotometric data base (ranging from the far UV to the near infrared) of the\ngalactic globular cluster NGC1904 (M79). The sample covers the entire cluster\nextension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present\npaper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial\ndistribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\\le 19.5$) BSS has been\ndetected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.\nNo significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts\nof NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied\nwith the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of\navoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that\nthe vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the\ncore. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by\nmass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the\ncluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall\npopulation.\n",

In this model, an extra gauge boson\ncorresponding to B-L gauge symmetry and an extra SM singlet scalar (heavy\nHiggs) are predicted. We show a detailed analysis of both heavy and light\nHiggses decay and production in addition to the possible decay channels of the\nnew gauge boson. We find that the cross sections of the SM-like Higgs\nproduction are reduced by ~ 20%-30%, while its decay branching ratios remain\nintact. The extra Higgs has relatively small cross sections and the branching\nratios of Z'-> l^+ l^- are of order ~20% compared to ~ 3% of the SM resuls.\nHence, the search for Z' is accessible via a clean dilepton signal at LHC.\n",

    "journal": "Proceedings of the XLV international winter meeting on nuclear\n  physics (2007) 1",
    "abstract": "  In the canonical formalism of statistical physics, a signature of a first\norder phase transition for finite systems is the bimodal distribution of an\norder parameter. Previous thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources produced\nin heavy-ion collisions provide information which support the existence of a\nphase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the\nobservable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable\norder parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral\ncollisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal\nbehaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the\nconstraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use\nthe canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour\nwith the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase\ntransition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison\nallows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative\ncomparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the\nZ1-E* plane which is in good agreement with that obtained with the signal of\nabnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat\ncapacity).\n",

However, traditional\nEuclidean methods require the knowledge of the full geometry to compute the\nblack hole thermodynamic quantities. We establish the connection between the\nentropy functional formalism and the standard Euclidean formalism taken at zero\ntemperature. We find that Sen's entropy function 'f' (on-shell) matches the\nzero temperature limit of the Euclidean action.

Globular patterns in the\nSTM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant\nstructural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that\nthey are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed\ncurrently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture\nsimulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the\npropagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular\ndynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape\nof the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and\nhow it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of\ndislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of\nthe clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations\nperpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured\nsamples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly\ninfluence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore\nhave to be regarded as physical entities.\n",

    "abstract": "  The paper is considering an opportunity for the CERN/GranSasso (CNGS)\nneutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with T2K and NOvA, to search for\ntheta_13 oscillations and CP violation. Compared with large water Cherenkov\n(T2K) and fine grained scintillators (NOvA), the LAr-TPC offers a higher\ndetection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels may\nbe unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a\n20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developed\nfor the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we\nseek an extended international collaboration:\n  (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn\nfocussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC\naccelerator improvement program;\n  (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis\nfrom the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is\nunder consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;\n  (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an\nincrease in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully\nconsidered. It is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a set\nof many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, \"cloning\" the technology of\nthe T600. Further phases may foresee extensions of MODULAr to meet future\nphysics goals.\n  The experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided a\nnew hall is excavated in the vicinity of the Gran Sasso Laboratory and adequate\nfunding and participation are made available.\n",

    "abstract": "  The approximants xi, xi' and xi'_n of the quasicrystal Al-Mn-Pd display most\ninteresting plastic properties as for example phason-induced deformation\nprocesses (Klein, H., Audier, M., Boudard, M., de Boissieu, M., Beraha, L., and\nDuneau, M., 1996, Phil. Mag. A, 73, 309.) or metadislocations (Klein, H.,\nFeuerbacher, M., Schall, P., and Urban, K., 1999, Phys. Rev. Lett., 82, 3468.).\nHere we demonstrate that the phases and their deformed or defected states can\nbe described by a simple projection formalism in three-dimensional space - not\nas usual in four to six dimensions. With the method we can interpret\nmicrostructures observed with electron microscopy as phasonic phase boundaries.\nFurthermore we determine the metadislocations of lowest energy and relate them\nuniquely to experimentally observed ones. Since moving metadislocations in the\nxi'-phase can create new phason-planes, we suggest a dislocation induced phase\ntransition from xi' to xi'_n. The methods developed in this paper can as well\nbe used for various other complex metallic alloys.\n",

The distribution function has a $\\delta$-like\nsingularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density\nhas a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent\nor vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations\nusing exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner\nordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger\nliquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it\noverestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the\nLuttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above\nfeatures correctly.

    "abstract": "  In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a protocol for growing graph states, the resource for one-way\nquantum computing, when the available entanglement mechanism is highly\nimperfect. The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits,\nrequiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli\nerror, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce\nlocal resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of\npurification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a\nbiased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more\nrapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented\nof how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a\nsingle Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\\sim 10$ times the\nimperfection in local operations.\n",

    "journal": "Journal of Econometrics (2008)",
    "abstract": "  We point out some pitfalls related to the concept of an oracle property as\nused in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known\npitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a\nconsequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying\na sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss\nfunction; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the\nloss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the\nframework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that\nsetting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in\nfinite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator\nintroduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather\npoorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to\nmaximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator\nis tuned to sparsity.\n",

In a first stage we study the\nsemi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single\nhard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the\nwall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard\nwalls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.\nFor higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even\nfor very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model\nused was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure\nFunctional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation\napproximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked\nexperimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical\nmotions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between\nthe grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which\nentropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface\nphenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.\n",

Although many details of top flavor\nviolation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top\nFCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We\nstudy these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy\neffective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the\nmost important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current\nconstraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level\nobservable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first\nor second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for\ntop decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks.

The 8 and 24 micron emission is\nco-spatial with H\\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC\n6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3} to 10^{-2},\nsupport previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor\ncompared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately\n1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations\nare the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects.

Here I\ndevelop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector\nby mapping the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.\nFor 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are\ncalculated to third order in partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered\nchiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading\nchiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as\nwell as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with\nvirtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators\nin loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The\npattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings\nare discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice\nresults obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the\nrestoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit.

This paper reports on multisite campaigns of the pulsating sdB stars\nPG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091. Data were obtained from observatories placed\naround the globe for coverage from all longitudes. For PG 1618+563B, our\nfive-site campaign uncovered a dichotomy of pulsation states: Early during the\ncampaign the amplitudes and phases (and perhaps frequencies) were quite\nvariable while data obtained late in the campaign were able to fully resolve\nfive stable pulsation frequencies. For PG 0048+091, our five-site campaign\nuncovered a plethora of frequencies with short pulsation lifetimes. We find\nthem to have observed properties consistent with stochastically excited\noscillations, an unexpected result for subdwarf B stars. We discuss our\nfindings and their impact on subdwarf B asteroseismology.\n",

The second sector, which decouples\nfrom the total Hamiltonian, is equivalent to the phase space description of the\nassociated non dynamical pure TFT. Within canonical quantisation, a likewise\nfactorisation of quantum states thus arises for the full spectrum of TMGT in\nany dimension. This new factorisation scheme also enables a definition of the\nusual projection from TMGT onto topological quantum field theories in a most\nnatural and transparent way.

We find strong evidence\nof evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of the\nstructure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fraction\nis strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. We also confirm that\nthe crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r < 10 AU.

    "abstract": "  (Abridged) We use 3D SPH calculations with higher resolution, as well as with\nmore realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to\nexamine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in\nsemi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral\nmode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc\ncause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump\ncycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We\ncompare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to\nfaithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented\ndurations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass\nratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved\nsimulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump\nperiod excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed\nblack hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower\ndisc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to\nhigher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous\ndissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the\ndisc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,\nthe viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new\nequilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We\nquantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.\nWe characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show\nthat the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.\n",

Using a synchrotron self-Compton mechanism, the\nphase-resolved spectra with the energy range from 100 eV to 3 GeV of the Crab\npulsar can also be explained.\n",

    "abstract": "  The tilt modulus of a defective Abrikosov vortex lattice pinned by material\nline defects is computed using the boson analogy. It tends to infinity at long\nwavelength, which yields a Bose glass state that is robust to the addition of\nweak point-pinning centers, and which implies a restoring force per vortex line\nfor rigid translations about mechanical equilibrium that is independent of\nmagnetic field. It also indicates that the Bose glass state breaks into pieces\nalong the direction of the correlated pinning centers if the latter have finite\nlength. The critical current is predicted to crossover from two dimensional to\nthree dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the\ncorrelated pinning centers in such case. That crossover notably can occur at a\nfilm thickness that is much larger than that expected from point pins of\ncomparable strength. The above is compared to the dependence on thickness shown\nby the critical current in certain films of high-temperature superconductors\ncurrently being developed for wire technology.\n",

In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density\nwaves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical\ntransition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed\neven above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the\nresistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than\nin the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable\nnesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by\nthe same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of\nalternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the\nmost fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest\ndevelopments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the\nmost studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is\ndriven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.\nOur findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,\nexperimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical\napproaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are\nintriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.\n",

This does not require additional\nconstraints, such as are often inferred from theoretical stellar models or\nmodel atmospheres. The planet's surface gravity can therefore be measured\nprecisely and from only directly observable quantities. We outline the method\nand apply it to the case of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD\n209458b. We find a surface gravity of g_p = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m/s, which is an\norder of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its\nmass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lower\nsurface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gas\ngiant planets. We apply our method to all fourteen known transiting extrasolar\nplanets and find a significant correlation between surface gravity and orbital\nperiod, which is related to the known correlation between mass and period. This\ncorrelation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamental\nparameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.\n",

It is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we have\ncross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistencies\nbetween them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmed\nclusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog\ncontains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the\nUBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where\navailable, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color\ndistribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The\nintrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to\n10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion\nof rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the\ndN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical\nsingle stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity\nrelation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.\nAnalysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that\nyounger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of\nM33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33\nfield stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater\nthan 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and\ndiscussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more\ncomplete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square\ndegrees centered on M33.\n",

The usefulness of such states for quantum\ncommunication protocols with continuous variables, like telecloning and\nteleportation networks, is finally discussed.\n",

    "abstract": "  We consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of a\npost-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator\nhere refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model\n(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing\nprocedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by\nleast-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show\nthat it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with\nreasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no\nestimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).\nThis follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance\nof estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the\nprobability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower\nbounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the\nsituation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the\ndistribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection\nestimator.\n",

The sample consists of 350\ntime-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is\nfitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to\nthe central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the\nblack hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the\niron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The\ndata reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,\nbut finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that\nthis relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the\nnarrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a\ndiagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation\nbetween the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely\nthe result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an\nanti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample\nas a whole, but not for the individual galaxies and galaxy types.\n",

However, very few X-ray polarization\nmeasurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst\nseveral objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.\nIn this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization\nfrom cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with\nthe proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use\nGeant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus\nX-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6\nand 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration\nflight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the\npolarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals\nusing chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,\nfor the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is\nassumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for\nweaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be\nrejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%\npolarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%\npolarization.\n",

Many\nother telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes\nTelescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical\nemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and\nX-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main\npeak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt\nemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.\nThe Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from\n1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The\noptical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather\nthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED\nshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour\nmight be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities\nsimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The\nafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.\nAlthough the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are\nconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is\nthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a\ncombination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of\n2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is\ndetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for the\nbeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.\n",

Therefore, in future hard\nX-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),\nthe X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also\nin the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]\n  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering\ncontribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in\nterms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established\ntheory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the\nbasis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical\ntranslation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice\nversa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This\nPSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the\nH(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.\n  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to\ncompute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the\nPSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse\nproblem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror\nsurface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows\nestablishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given\nH(E) requirement. [...]\n",

It provides a unified description\nfor all kinds of devices from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes to\nsilicon transistors covering different transport regimes from the ballistic to\nthe diffusive limit.

    "journal": "Geophysical Journal International 172 (2), 817-841 (2008)",
    "abstract": "  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the\nlithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by\nmantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external\nforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On\none-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an\nimportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the\ndeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the\nassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity\nand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the\nlithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing\nthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable\nYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except\nfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the\ntransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include\nbottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress\nfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further\nshow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness\nvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the\ndegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal\ntangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell\nand are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure\nequations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the\nprediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the\nconstruction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.\n",

Instead, we detected a strong narrow emission near the location of the\nsecondary star. We measured the radial velocity curve from the wings of the\ndouble-peaked H$\\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value that\nis in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in the\nultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al. (1998). We present also a new method\nto obtain K_2, which enhances the detection of absorption or emission features\narising in the late-type companion. Our results are compared with published\nvalues derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison of\nthe TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit is\nobtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at that\nspectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect\naccurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em =\n107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by\nZhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD =\n1.20+/-0.05 M_sun,; M_RD = 0.42+/-0.04 M_sun; and a = 1.55+/- 0.02 R_sun.

    "abstract": "  The early Solar System contained short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe (t1/2\n= 1.5 Myr) whose most likely source was a nearby supernova. Previous models of\nSolar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse\nof the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,\nthat the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very\nclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.\nWe conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions\nrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close\nsupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations\ndemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to\nescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss\noccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the\ndisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These\nlow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the\nhigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk\nbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be\nconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On\nthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into\ndust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be\ninjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic\nabundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are\nconsistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1\npc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.\n",

    "abstract": "  We quantify the effect of supernova Type Ia peculiar velocities on the\nderivation of cosmological parameters. The published distant and local Ia SNe\nused for the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report form the\nsample for this study. While previous work has assumed that the local SNe are\nat rest in the CMB frame (the No Flow assumption), we test this assumption by\napplying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different\nflow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, have\nvarying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB\nframe. These datasets are then fit for w, Omega_m, and Omega_Lambda using\nflatness or LambdaCDM and a BAO prior. The chi^2 statistic is used to examine\nthe effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. The most\nfavored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly better\nthan the No Flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocity\nstudies. By comparing the No Flow assumption with the favored models we derive\nthe largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiar\nvelocities to be Delta w = +0.04. For Omega_Lambda, the potential error is\nDelta Omega_Lambda = -0.04 and for Omega_m, the potential error is Delta\nOmega_m < +0.01. The favored flow model (beta=0.5) produces the following\ncosmological parameters: w = -1.08 (+0.09,-0.08), Omega_m = 0.27 (+0.02,-0.02)\nassuming a flat cosmology, and Omega_Lambda = 0.80 (+0.08,-0.07) and Omega_m =\n0.27 (+0.02,-0.02) for a w = -1 (LambdaCDM) cosmology.\n",

    "abstract": "  It is known that within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian for the\none-dimensional 1/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal\nonly if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a\ncritical value. We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction\nis different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with\nincreasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can\noccur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls\nstate that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from\nthe Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from\nthe spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by\nchanges in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band\nquasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1\ntetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene\n(TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments\nstrongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in\nseveral members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different\nantiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase\ndiagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have\neither the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge\noccupancies. The spin-Peierls state is always a Bond-Charge-Density Wave.\n",

The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN\nwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their\nspectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity\nFunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with\nprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our\ndata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us\nto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By\ncombining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted\nfrom the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different\nevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the\ncombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is\na luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived\nfrom the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the\nAGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the\nexcess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we\nfind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that\nthe peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift\ngoing to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of\nX-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of \"AGN cosmic\ndownsizing\", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to\nmore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than\nthat of low luminosity ones.\n",

Deep, wide-field observations for this\nproject were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont\ntelescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Careful attention in reduction and\nanalysis was paid to the illumination correction, background subtraction, point\nspread function determination, and galaxy subtraction. ICL flux is detected in\nboth bands in all ten clusters ranging from 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11}\nh^{-1} solar luminosities in r and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar\nluminosities in the B-band. These fluxes account for 6 to 22% of the total\ncluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the\nB-band. Average ICL B-r colors range from 1.5 to 2.8 mags when k and evolution\ncorrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group\nenvironments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1} Mpc distant from the\ncluster center. Our sample, having been selected from the Abell sample, is\nincomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density,\nlow flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high\nflux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations\nbetween ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do\nfind that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally\nconcentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is\nconsistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or\nforming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.\n",

Motivated by the\nanalogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the\nexactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer\nsystem, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the\nabundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic\nnetwork.

    "abstract": "  A significant fraction of Lyman Alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z>\n5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. However\nonly a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmitted\nthrough the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of the\nmaximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass\nfunction. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya\nemission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters\nin which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results\nin a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation\nwith a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift\nobservations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the\nfollowing eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with\nplausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star\nformation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,\nv-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at\nz=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the\nobserved correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the\nobserved anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very\nmassive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the\ngalaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate\nthe presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop\ngalaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.\n",

    "abstract": "  The role of the equation of state for a perfectly conducting, relativistic\nmagnetized fluid is the main subject of this work. The ideal constant\n$\\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of\nastrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state\nthat better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on\nthree different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of\nstate on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This\ncalls into question the validity of the constant $\\Gamma$-law equation of state\nin problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across\nhydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover\nprimitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative\nones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic\nnumerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.\nFinally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including\nmagnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using\ndifferent equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a\nrealistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when\ntransitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these\ncircumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the\nsolution.\n",

First, a nucleation coupled model for\ndegradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to\ndecay by fragmentation and formation of clusters.

The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force\nare employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at\nthe device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and\nintegration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The\nsimulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results.

    "abstract": "  The unusual properties of transition objects (young stars with an optically\nthin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that\nsignificant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature\nof these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar\naccretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T\nTauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy\na restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition\nsingle stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically\n~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.\nThese properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories\nand suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant\nrole in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering\ntransition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri\nstars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion\nrates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of\nunity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.\n",

Several models of the ISRF\nexist. The most recent one, which has been calculated by us, predicts a\nsignificantly higher ISRF than the well-used model of Mathis, Mezger, and\nPanagia. However,comparison with data is limited to local observations. Based\non our current estimate of the ISRF we predict the gamma-ray emission in the\nSNRs G0.9+0.1 and RXJ1713, and pair-production absorption features above 20 TeV\nin the spectra of G0.9+0.1, J1713-381, and J1634-472. We discuss how GLAST,\nalong with current and future very high energy instruments, may be able to\nprovide upper bounds on the large-scale ISRF.\n",

This paper focuses on one\ntheoretical issue of this development which is concerned with oscillatory\nbehavior of a viscoelastic solid globe in the regime of quasistatic,\nforce-free, non-compressional oscillations less investigated in the literature\ncompared to oscillations in the regime of standing shear waves.

The efficiency of this method\nis demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar\nastrophysics dealing with oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic\nFermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density,\nthe shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.\n",

A quantum hologram has a higher storage\ncapacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum\nfeatures of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantum\nstates, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve.

    "abstract": "  We have observed the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588\nwith the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). In this manuscript we report the\ndiscovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The\nkilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state\nreminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO\npeak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single\ntrial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency\nhave only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency\nis higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly\nsuggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in\nLMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the\nhighest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc\nfrom a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent\nflux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of\nthe weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The\nroot-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this\nis the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general\nanti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz\nQPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a\ncolour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further\nevidence for the atoll nature of the source.\n",

Morphological classification is performed\nby visual inspection of images in the $g$ band. The catalogue contains 2253\ngalaxies complete to a magnitude limit of $r=16$ after Galactic extinction\ncorrection, selected from 2658 objects that are judged as extended in the\nphotometric catalogue in the same magnitude limit. 1866 galaxies in our\ncatalogue have spectroscopic information. A brief statistical analysis is\npresented for the frequency of morphological types and mean colours in the\ncatalogue. A visual inspection of the images reveals that the rate of\ninteracting galaxies in the local Universe is approximately 1.5% in the\n$r\\le16$ sample. A verification is made for the photometric catalogue generated\nby the SDSS, especially as to its bright end completeness.\n",

The first one is a 41 GHz flux-limited sample extracted from the\nWMAP 3-yr catalog of microwave point sources. This is a statistically well\ndefined sample of about 200 blazars and radio galaxies, most of which are\nexpected to be detected by GLAST. The second one is a new deep survey of\nBlazars selected among the radio sources that are spatially coincident with\nserendipitous sources detected in deep X-ray images (0.3-10 keV) centered on\nthe Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) discovered by the Swift satellite. This sample is\nparticularly interesting from a statistical viewpoint since a) it is unbiased\nas GRBs explode at random positions in the sky, b) it is very deep in the X-ray\nband (\\fx \\simgt $10^{-15}$ \\ergs) with a position accuracy of a few\narc-seconds, c) it will cover a fairly large (20-30 square deg.) area of sky,\nd) it includes all blazars with radio flux (1.4 GHz) larger than 10 mJy, making\nit approximately two orders of magnitude deeper than the WMAP sample and about\none order of magnitude deeper than the deepest existing complete samples of\nradio selected blazars, and e) it can be used to estimate the amount of\nunresolved GLAST high latitude gamma-ray background and its anisotropy\nspectrum.\n",

First, we review how partial flag manifolds (generalizing\nGrassmannians) are described physically by nonabelian gauged linear sigma\nmodels, paying attention to realizations of tangent bundles and other aspects\npertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau\ncomplete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged\nlinear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in\nwhich the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is\nrealized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending\nprevious work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM\nexhibiting the same phenomenon. We tentatively identify the mathematical\nrelationship between such non-birational phases, as examples of Kuznetsov's\nhomological projective duality. Finally, we discuss linear sigma model moduli\nspaces in these gauged linear sigma models. We argue that the moduli spaces\nbeing realized physically by these GLSM's are precisely Quot and hyperquot\nschemes, as one would expect mathematically.\n",

Our study aims at\nquantifying the star-formation and AGN processes in these sources which recent\nresults suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. To\ndo this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and\nextinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated\nsources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of\nstar-formation activity. These sources have redder mid-IR colors than typical\noptically-selected quasars. About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission,\nbut none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high\n5um hot dust continua. However, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest that\nstar-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. Six of our z~2\nsources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At\nthese luminosities, such high EW6.2 ULIRGs do not exist in the local Universe.\nWe find a median optical depth at 9.7um of <tau_9.7>=1.4. This is consistent\nwith local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on\nSCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show\nextreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find\nthat our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude\nmore luminous. It is not clear whether our z~2 ULIRGs are simply scaled-up\nversions of local ULIRGs, or subject to fundamentally different physical\nprocesses.\n",

We find\nlittle spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellite\npopulation. The velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator of\nthe virial velocity of the halo: \\sigma_{sat}/V_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to\nthe Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s and\nV_{vir}^{M31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than the\nrotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulated\nsatellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellar\nhalo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the\npopulation of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite\ndepends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased\ntoward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our\nresults support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences\nbetween stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive\n``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,\nand were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that\nhas survived self-bound until the present.\n",
